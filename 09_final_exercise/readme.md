# Final Exercise

## Requirements & Scope
The final exercise will be a programming exercise of an openFrameworks application. The type of application can be chosen individually. However, the application must include/address:
  * Object-oriented design
  * At least two different topics from the course
  * An artistic idea that can be freely chosen 

The scope of the final exercise should be similar to the screenGrab refactoring and image processing task; it should not exceed that assignment! 

## Documentation 

Please add a short documentation along the lines of this [template file](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/blob/master/__content/template_post.md) plus an animated GIF or MP4 file that demonstrates your final sketch.

## Notes 

Other than that, the final exercise should be your chance to freely practice how to express an artistic idea with openFrameworks. This includes all the challenges this might involve like finding an idea, drafting a technical concept, implementing it. Please try to make sure that all of theses aspects fit into the time frame even if this may result in a presumably "simple" sketch. Note down and reflect on the process.

Please note that I really would like you to use this exercise as an option for you to experiment and explore what you have learned in this course. Do not worry if you think your ideas are too small or too big. With the final exercise, I would like you to enjoy the development. 

As discussed in the session, use the code examples provided in the code folder of the previous session as a starting point for your own sketch. Let them inspire you and wrap your head around those as well as the content we have addressed throughout the course. Come up with your own idea and interests. Feel free to review the **suggestions** provided in the assignment's folder of the previous session as further inspirations.

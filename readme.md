# Syllabus

## 1 Intro to Course and IDE setup 

Week 1 -- 6.4.

- overview of topics
- orga and grading

- technical setup, not everyone will use the same ide, system, ... 
  - Xcode
  - MS Visual Studio Community
  - VS Code
  - git setup
  - git ignore 
  - create a dedicated setup file

## 2 Build Process and ofx SDK 

 Week 1 -- 8.4.

1. compilation, linking, building vs interpreter
2. compiler errors 
3. linker errors
4. statically typed vs dynamically typed languages
5. project files
6. project generator
7. openframeworks folder structure

Homework: 
- [How OF Works](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)
- Learncpp syntax
- play around with the ide and ofExamples. 
- build the examples, get used to the syntax
- note down your questions
- pick one or two examples that you like specifically
  - what do you like about them?
  - what makes them technically appealing?
  - what makes them artistically appealing?
  - (find an alternative with processing)


## 3 Syntax and Cpp Programm Setup 

(Week 2, Wed 15.4. (after Easter holiday))

Homework discussion: 
- build groups of two, discuss your examples
- pick one example that you both find interesting and would like to better understand
- every groups presents one app they would like to better understand


1. C++ by example of an ofApp
2. syntax simple
3. header vs cpp file 
4. declaration and definition
5. recap build process and how .h und .cpp are related


Homework: 
- Change variables in the examples
- Reading material on Cpp syntax
- [OOPs!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html) << a deeper explanation of what we did in class
- Error sheet / double check for theses errors


## 4 Object-oriented Programming I

 (Week 3, Mo 20.4.)

1. your own App
2. project generator recap
3. variables and scope
4. functions and scope
5. built in types
6. take an example and change it

Homework:

Ressources -- Tyler Henry
- **Bouncing Square** make a Square class
- **Bouncing Squares** make an array of Square objects
- **Shapes** draw some simple stuff, use colors


1.	Create a simple animation using a class of your own design.  You can use the Square class as a template for your code.  
	Play with color, shape, size, movement, speed, etc.  
	  	- the class you write should contain both an update() and a draw() function  
		- try to use an array

1.  Try to make an interactive app, using mouse movement or keyboard presses.  Don't worry if you get stuck, just go as far as you can.

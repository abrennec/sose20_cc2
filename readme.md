# Syllabus

## Week 1 - Intro and Setup -- 6.4., 8.4.

### Intro to Course and IDE setup 
- overview of topics
- orga and grading
- intro to openframeworks with example

### Technical setup 
- technical setup, not everyone will use the same ide, system, ... 
  - Xcode
  - MS Visual Studio Community
  - VS Code
  - git setup
  - git ignore 
  - create a dedicated setup file

### openFrameworks Setup

- Intro to the folder structure
- Example of an ofApp Example
- first intro to c++ code

Homework: 
- [How OF Works](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/how_of_works.html)
- Learncpp syntax
- play around with the ide and ofExamples. 
- build the examples, get used to the syntax
- note down your questions
- pick one or two examples that you like specifically
  - what do you like about them?
  - what makes them technically appealing?
  - what makes them artistically appealing?
  - (find an alternative with processing)

- make first changes to a simple example
- Change variables in the examples and turn the examples into an own piece of art
- check out the documentation to get familiar

---

## Week 2 -- (Week 2, Wed 15.4. (after Easter holiday))

Homework discussion: 
- build groups of two, discuss your examples
- pick one example that you both find interesting and would like to better understand
- every groups presents one app they would like to better understand

### Build Process and ofx SDK 

1. compilation, linking, building vs interpreter
2. compiler errors 
3. linker errors

## 3 ofApp Syntax and Cpp Programm Setup 

- Intro to project generator
- create your first app
- create a first animation

1. C++ by example of an ofApp
2. syntax simple
3. header vs cpp file 
4. declaration and definition
5. recap build process and how .h und .cpp are related


Homework: 
- Reading material on Cpp syntax
- [OOPs!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html) << a deeper explanation of what we did in class
- Error sheet / double check for theses errors


## Week 3 OOP Basics -- 20.4., 22.4.


1. your own App
2. project generator and project files recap
3. variables and scope
4. functions and scope
5. built in types
6. statically typed vs dynamically typed languages


Homework: 

<!--
Ressources -- Tyler Henry
- **Bouncing Square** make a Square class
- **Bouncing Squares** make an array of Square objects
- **Shapes** draw some simple stuff, use colors


-	Create a simple animation using a class of your own design.  You can use the Square class as a template for your code.  
	Play with color, shape, size, movement, speed, etc.  
	  	- the class you write should contain both an update() and a draw() function  
		- try to use an array

-  Try to make an interactive app, using mouse movement or keyboard presses.  Don't worry if you get stuck, just go as far as you can.

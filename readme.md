# Overview of the Course

## Organization 

- Mondays and Wednesdays 11:30 h - 13 h
- Module 5 | 3 SWS | 4 ECTS
- 10 weeks

During the time of online lectures, we will use the lecture hours for consultation times.

## Course Description 

This course builds on the concepts presented in ‘Creative Coding I’ and introduces the software development toolkit [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc). openFrameworks is a creative coding toolkit dedicated to realtime development written in C++. We will specifically use it

- to introduce the C++ programming language & corresponding build processes,
- to explore object-orientation and realtime development with C++,
- to get familiar with software and library design.

openFrameworks is comprised of a huge body of example projects as well as additional functionality (ofxAddons) that we will explore during the course.

We will get to know the overarching topic of the course **interaction and interfaces** in larger and smaller projects. As an artistic starting point, we will deal with topics such as poetry, imagery or music and develop a digital representation and/or interpretation using openFrameworks.

There will be smaller term projects as well as a **final project** which will be an individual piece of work. The requirements and scope of the final project will be defined at the end of the lecture series. The project can be an individual as well as a group work. 

**Deadline for submitting the final project is September 30th, 2020.** To successfully submit your final project, upload the code, documentation, and any additional material required to a dedicated Git repository and share the link to the repository with Prof. Brennecke via email.

# Communication & Materials

As a communication platform, we will use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to share code, lecture materials, comments, and submit homework and project assignments.

- [GitHub repository (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/sose20_cc2)
- [GitHub Wiki (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/sose20_cc2/wiki)
- [GitHub team (public)](https://github.com/orgs/ctechfilmuniversity/teams/sose20_cc2)

The repository will be used to share scripts (usually as readme.md) and slides, coding examples, homework and project materials. The Wiki will be maintained by the students to share information that might be useful for everyone, for example, dos and don'ts, useful links, results of homework assignments, and so on. The team will be used for discussion, comments, notes and any important announcements.

This course will start as an online course which requires everyone to work individually. You will have to work through materials and assignments on your own. There will be slots for discussions twice a week. Make sure that you are prepared when bringing your questions to those slots. Make use of the Github team as well as openFrameworks forum when you are stuck and post your questions there. This term, we have to work together as a group more than usually and everyone is invited to help out. Also, there will be individual consultation options for everyone.

## Assignments

Assignments will be given at the end of each class. If the assignments comprise written or coded homework, please create a folder named <my_last_name>, add your solutions and upload the folder to the assignments folder of the corresponding session. See the readme.md inside of the assignments folder for any additional info as well as the list of assignments.

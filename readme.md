# Overview of the Course

## Organization 

- Mondays and Wednesdays 11:30 h - 13 h
- Module 5 | 3 SWS | 4 ECTS
- 18 sessions in total

**NOTE**: The course will be held online until further notice. During the time of online lectures, we will use the lecture hours for updates, discussions and consultation times.

## Course Description 

This course builds on the concepts presented in ‘Creative Coding I’ and introduces the software development toolkit [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc). openFrameworks is a creative coding toolkit dedicated to realtime development written in C++. We will specifically use it

- to introduce the C++ programming language & corresponding build processes
- to explore object-orientation and realtime development with C++
- to get familiar with using a software development kits

openFrameworks is comprised of a huge body of example projects as well as additional functionality (ofxAddons) that we will explore during the course.

We will get to know the overarching topic of the course **interaction and interfaces** in larger and smaller projects. As an artistic starting point, we will deal with topics such as poetry, imagery or music and develop a digital representation and/or interpretation using openFrameworks.

## Method of Instruction

This course will start as an online course which requires an increased amount of personal work and participation in the development of problem solutions. You will have to work through materials and assignments on your own. There will be slots for discussions twice a week. Make sure that you are prepared when bringing your questions to those slots. Make use of the Github team as well as openFrameworks forum when you are stuck and post your questions there. This term, we have to work together as a group more than usually and everyone is invited to help out.

On Mondays, new learning material and assignments will be published. We will meet online to check-in briefly and discuss open questions. On Wednesdays, we will have a check-in meeting for questions. All assignments will be given a dedicated deadline. In general, please upload any code assignments to the assignment's folder on GitHub and put your research solutions to the GitHub Wiki. You will work in groups of two. Every group has to do a little research on one artistic and on one technical topic and share it with the class in one of the meetings and on the Wiki. At the end of the lecture, a final exercise will be assigned that will be an individually chosen task.

# Communication & Materials

As a communication platform, we will use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to share code, lecture materials, comments, and submit homework and project assignments.

- [GitHub repository (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/sose20_cc2)
- [GitHub Wiki (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/sose20_cc2/wiki)
- [GitHub team (public)](https://github.com/orgs/ctechfilmuniversity/teams/sose20_cc2)

The repository will be used to share scripts (usually as readme.md) and slides, coding examples, homework and project materials. The Wiki will be maintained by the students to share information that might be useful for everyone, for example, dos and don'ts, useful links, results of homework assignments, and so on. The team will be used for discussion, comments, notes and any important announcements.


## Assignments

If the assignments comprise written or coded homework, please create a folder named <my_last_name>, add your solutions and upload the folder to the assignments folder of the corresponding session.

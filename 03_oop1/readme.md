# Object-oriented Programming


- oop
  - encapsulation
  - abstraction
  - inheritance
  - polymorphism
- cpp class
  - constructor
  - destructor
  - member variables
  - member functions
  - access levels
- inheritance

- fbo

openFrameworks Essentials:

"Redirecting drawing to the offscreen buffer
The offscreen buffer is a virtual screen in video memory, where we can draw anything just as we can on a real screen. The resultant picture can be used as an image or texture. We can draw it on a real screen, process with shader, or use to texture 3D objects.
In the OpenGL library, which is used by openFrameworks for drawing, the offscreen
buffer is called Frame Buffer Object (FBO). Naturally, in openFrameworks, this buffer is maintained by the ofFbo class."

# Type Conversion

-> slides

# Debugging

Debugging is a development process used to analyze the source code during runtime. In the screencast on the ofApp presented earlier, you saw how to start the debugging process in XCode. There is additional material available on how to start debugging with Visual Studio Community prepared for you. In both cases you will previously need to build a debug version of your application, as described in the screencast.


# Reading Material

## Recap 

Revise and Review

- [Object-oriented Programming (OOP) & openFrameworks/C++](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)
  - Note that this introduction is not flawless but it gives you a good idea about how OOP works with openFrameworks

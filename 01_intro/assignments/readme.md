# Assignments

## 1 Learning Materials & Resources 

- Work your way through the [script](../readme.md) including the (required!) reading material provided at the end of the script.
- Checkout the cc2 repository and get familiar with the resources provided.

## 2 Development Setup 

- Follow the instructions in the [script](../readme.md) and setup your development environment including an IDE and openFrameworks.

## 2 Practical Exercises

### 2.1 Searching the Examples (4 pts)
- Check out the openFrameworks examples folders and build a couple of the examples.
- Identify an example that you like. 
  - What do you like about them? 
  - What makes them artistically or technically interesting for you?
  - Note down a few keywords and submit them following the description on the [main page](../../readme.md).


### 2.2 Modifying the Examples (6 pts)

Go to the blending example:

```
ofRoot/examples/graphics/blendingExample
```

- Open the solution, build the example, and check out the app.
- Review the source code and try to understand what is happening.
- Go to the [openFrameworks documentation](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/) and checkout the graphics section for additional information, e.g., look for the "ofEnableBlendMode()" documentation.
- Now add a colorized circle and rectangle to the app. 
  - Where do you have to define this code?
  - Ckeckout the following functions:
    - ofDrawCircle
    - ofDrawRectangle
    - ofSetColor
- When you are done, copy the source code, i.e., the folder "blendingExample" to your assignment folder and upload it following the description on the [main page](../../readme.md). Make sure that you are using an appropriate .gitignore file in order not to upload any binary files.

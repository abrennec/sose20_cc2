## 1 Resources
Checkout the openFrameworks website and get familiar with the resources provided: https://openframeworks.cc

## 2 Setup
In order to work with openFrameworks, you will have to download and unpack the openFrameworks SDK for your platform (see 2.1). Also, you have to download and install a dedicated integrated development environment (IDE) for your platform (see 2.2) that will allow you to compile, build and run the native applications on your platform. Please note, there are several options to build openFrameworks applications. During this course, only two of them will be primarily supported: macOS together with XCode and MS Windows together with MS Visual Studio Community 2017. If you want to work on a different platform or with a different IDE, you have to check out the openFrameworks forum for further support. 


## Reading
- Checkout the ofBook and skim through the first chapters. Take a close look at the openFrameworks folder structure:
  - https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html
  - https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/of_philosophy.html
  - https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/cplusplus_basics.html
  - https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/setup_and_project_structure.html
- Get familiar with C++ syntax. Checkout https://wwww.learncpp.com:
  - Recap the build process with Chapter 0
  - Skim through Chapter 1, read 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 carefully
  - Skim through Chapter 2, read 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3

## Practical Exercises 
- Check out the openFrameworks examples and build them. Identify two examples that you like. What do you like about them in particular?
- Do a little freestyle research on creative coding projects that were implemented using openFrameworks. Identify one or two projects that you like and bring them to the next session.


# Howto

Assignments will be given at the end of each class. If the assignments comprise written or coded homework, please create a folder named <my_last_name>, add your solutions to this folder and upload the folder to the assignments folder of the corresponding session.

The coding examples 01_sine through 04_sine presented here are original or modified versions of Zach Lieberman's RTO_SFPC_FALL19 class taken from the following repository: https://github.com/ofZach/RTP_SFPC_FALL19

The myRomanticSketch example is by Angela Brennecke whereas the myStridePatternSketch example is taken from the book "openFrameworks Essentials". Both examples contain several errors and need to be fixed first.

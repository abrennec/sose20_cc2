# Assignments | optional!

_Meaningful_ bullet points are sufficient to answer the questions - if necessary.


### Creative Concept | 3 pts

Read the script on sound and audio processing with openFrameworks. Think about the scree grab example. How would the integration of sound add to the current application? What would you like to implement? Let your ideas flow.

### Inheritance | 4 pts

Find two examples of class inheritance in the openFrameworks SDK. As a starting point, you could review the relationship between ofApp and ofBaseApp class. Furthermore, find out to what class the audioIn and audioOut functions belong to. Why can these be used inside of ofApp?

### Final Exercise | 3 pts

Start thinking about a final exercise. The requirements are listed in the script. Feel free to come up with an individual idea. I will add a few suggestions, too. Review the code examples provided for inspiration. You can also think about an optimization or extension of the screen grab example. 

The scope of the final exercise should be similar to the scree grab refactoring and image processing task.

# Assignments

_Meaningful_ bullet points are sufficient to answer the questions - if necessary.

### 1 Interaction | 2 pts

Please read the first section of the script "Review & Preview" and reflect on the three questions on interaction. Work in a team of at least two or in the group. 

The main goal of this task is to exchange thoughts and ideas, reflect on your own attitude, interests, and concerns and come up with a first definition of what interaction and interfaces might be.

Discuss and consider how images, image manipulations algorithms and/or the objects presented in the script can be used as means of interaction or interface.

Create a dedicated wiki page where you note down the results of your discussions and individual thoughts.

### 2 Screen Grab Img Balls | up to 3 (was 8) pts

#### 2.1 Image Manipulation

- Build and run the code examples by ofZach and tyhenry on image and video manipulation. Check the code to get an understanding of what is happening and how it is implemented.

- Review the [Creative Coding 1 script on processing, section "images",](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/ws1920_cc1/blob/master/04_processing/cc1_ws1920_04_processing_script.md#images) and check the different image filtering methods presented to get further inspiration.

#### 2.2 ofFbo

- Build and run the ofFbo examples and get an understanding of how a frame buffer object can be used.

#### *2.3 Your Creative Code Project*

> Note that this task will be reworked and integrated into the next worksheet.

Extend your screen grab project by additional objects and functionality. In the coding examples and the CC1 script you have seen different forms of image and video manipulation. Integrate at least one of the presented "image manipulation" (filtering, analysis, synthesis) methods into your project. Add at least one new object to the project. Add interaction to the project that occurs between the objects you have added. Work on a pixel and on a texture level if possible.

### 4 Pointers and References | 1 pts

Skim through the chapter [Pointers, References, and Arrays](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/67-introduction-to-pointers/). Although we have not touched upon this topic in the script in particular, you will find pointers, arrays, and references in the code examples. Also, we will dig into memory allocation next time. 

Please get a first understanding of what pointers and references in C++ are and **read** sections [6.7 on pointers](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/67-introduction-to-pointers/) and [6.11 on references](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/611-references/).

Note down your questions!

### 4 Bonus - Relaxation | up to 4 pts 

Feel free to pick one of the code examples by ofZach and tyhenry and extend, change, or modify the code to your liking.

Check out the official openFrameworks/examples/3d folder and build and run

- pointCloudExample
- meshFromCameraExample

Both show how you can use image information to create a 3D mesh. If this is an area that is interesting for you also in the context of shaders, feel free to explore, modify and adapt the code to your liking. There is also a chapter on [Generating Meshes from an Image](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/generativemesh.html) in the ofBook for more information.

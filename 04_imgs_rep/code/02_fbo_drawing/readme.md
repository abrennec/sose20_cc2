# openFrameworks tutorial series

## Lewos Lepton

Source files from my openFrameworks tutorial series.

To watch the openFrameworks series, you can go to here: [**openFrameworks tutorials**](https://www.youtube.com/c/lewislepton)

"These are the .cpp and .h files from my openFrameworks tutorial series.
Tutorial files will be uploaded when newer videos are made.
Pictures, audio and movies are given with the download. You will need to make a new project and then replace the files with these ones.


I do not comment the code whilst doing these tutorials. So its best to follow along with the videos to know what is actually happening ;)

Have fun and happy coding."

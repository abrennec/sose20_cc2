# The Frame Buffer Object

openFrameworks Essentials:

"Redirecting drawing to the offscreen buffer
The offscreen buffer is a virtual screen in video memory, where we can draw anything just as we can on a real screen. The resultant picture can be used as an image or texture. We can draw it on a real screen, process with shader, or use to texture 3D objects.
In the OpenGL library, which is used by openFrameworks for drawing, the offscreen
buffer is called Frame Buffer Object (FBO). Naturally, in openFrameworks, this buffer is maintained by the ofFbo class."

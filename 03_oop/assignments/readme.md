_Meaningful_ bullet points are sufficient to answer the questions - if necessary.

### 1 OOP - SineCircle Object | 3 pts

Read the script on object-oriented programming. Now based on what you have read and understood so far, your job will be to refactor the coding example 01_sine_oop so that it uses a SineCircle object inside of the ofApp. In order to achieve this, follow these steps:

- Create a header file and a definition file for the sineCircle class.
- Add both files to your ofApp project, i.e., put the into the src folder of 01_sine_oop and add them to the project in your IDE.
- Add a class specification to the header file.
- In the header file, declare all member variables and member functions that you need to describe your sineCircle - or to achieve the same rendering as in this original version.
- In the definition file, define the functions that you have declared.
- Take care of including the header files that you need.

Good luck!!

### 2 OOP - Constructors | 2 pts

As you know, the default ofApp code does not provide any constructors. Nevertheless, the ofApp object is constructed without any problem. 

- First question: Why?

Now, please create a default ofApp sketch with the ProjectGenerator. Review the main function. Inside of main, the graphics context is setup before the ofApp object is created. In the function call "ofSetupOpenGL", you can specify the window size. Although you can access the window size in the ofApp through calls to ofGetWindowWidth() and ofGetWindowHeight(), the design of the ofApp could be improved by directly handing over the window size parameters. 

- Create a user-defined constructor in the ofApp that takes the window width and window height arguments as function parameters.
- Create corresponding member variables in ofApp that store the window paramters in the ofApp object.
- Change the construction in the main function such that you hand over the window parameters to the ofApp object directly as part of the object construction.
- How could you ensure that only your specific user-defined constructor is going to be called? Remember that the default constructor is being generated by the compiler automatically if it does not exist.

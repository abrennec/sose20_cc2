# Overview of the Course

## Organization 

- Mondays and Wednesdays 11:30 h - 13 h
- Module 5 | 3 SWS | 4 ECTS
- 18 lectures in total


## Course Description 

This course builds on the concepts presented in ‘Creative Coding I’ and introduces the software development toolkit [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc). openFrameworks is a creative coding toolkit dedicated to realtime development written in C++. We will specifically use it

- to introduce the C++ programming language & corresponding build processes,
- to explore object-orientation and realtime development with C++,
- to get familiar with software and library design.

openFrameworks is comprised of a huge body of example projects as well as additional functionality (ofxAddons) that we will explore during the course.

We will get to know the overarching topic of the course **interaction and interfaces** in larger and smaller projects. As an artistic starting point, we will deal with topics such as poetry, imagery or music and develop a digital representation and/or interpretation using openFrameworks.

The **final project** will be an individual piece of work that can build upon the mid-term project or be a completely new piece of application. The requirements and scope of the final project will be defined at the end of the lecture series. The project can be an individual as well as a group work. 

**Deadline for submitting the final project is September 30th, 2020.** To successfully submit your final project, upload the code, documentation, and any additional material required to a dedicated Git repository and share the link to the repository with Prof. Brennecke via email.


## Learning Objectives

- Extending your programming skills towards software design
- Object-oriented analysis and design
- Understanding and working with a high-level programming language like C++
- Understanding and working with a complex SDK like openFrameworks
- Expressing your artistic ideas by the means of C++ and openFrameworks
- Interpreting an artistic idea as a piece of software

# Communication & Materials

As a communication platform, we will use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to share code, lecture materials, comments, and submit homework and project assignments.

- [GitHub repository (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/sose20_cc2)
- [GitHub Wiki (public)](https://github.com/ctechfilmuniversity/sose20_cc2/wiki)
- [GitHub team (public)](https://github.com/orgs/ctechfilmuniversity/teams/sose20_cc2)

The repository will be used to share scripts (usually as readme.md) and slides, coding examples, homework and project materials. The Wiki will be maintained by the students to share information that might be useful for everyone, for example, results of homework assignments. The team will be used for discussion, comments, notes and any important announcements.
